# Angular 6 with socket.io Example Client

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5 and is a part of AngularSocketIO-Example, an example, where Angular CLI cooperates with Socket.IO

You can find the whole tutorial, if you click [here]();

## Set-up 

Download the project and run `ng serve` for a dev server and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. Or run `ng serve --o` / `ng serve --open` to open up the browser with the url automatically. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Be sure, that you have downloaded or written the server code, otherwise it constantly outputs `Get "link of localhost:3000, where socket.io should be running" 0 ()` error messages in the console.
